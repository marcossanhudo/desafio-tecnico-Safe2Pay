## English (US)

This is a simple test project used in the application process for a position as a test analyst at Safe2Pay.  
It is written in JavaScript, and uses the PactumJS testing tool, and the Mocha test runner, to run automated tests on DummyAPI endpoints.

To run this application, clone this repository, and run the following commands:
```
    npm install
    mocha
```

Test cases are in the ```test.js``` file. To make the code more modular and easier to maintain, endpoint paths, required headers, and useable request bodies have been stored in a separate folder, called "```variables```".
